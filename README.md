# Discord Scraper   

I built this to practice a bit of python. It requires you to get your discord token. Here is a guide: https://www.androidauthority.com/get-discord-token-3149920/

You must enable developer mode on discord in order to get the channel ID you want to scrape. Scraped messages are output as a .txt file. 


## Installation


Clone the repo, unpack with your favorite archive manager (cough 7zip), go to the dist foler and run the .exe, windows is going to yell at you. Just ignore it. Scraped messages will output next to the .exe file.
